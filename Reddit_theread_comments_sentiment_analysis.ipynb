      "3. This surely was the game to play Auba and Broja together, right? Speed in central defense and tracking runners are Brentford's 2 main weakness at the back. Broja is showing his physicality and aggression with his press and playing direct, but Havertz looks lost out there. The pair are really out of sync with their positioning and movements in the box.\n",
      "4. Chalobah and Kepa have looked very composed, which is great to see. Toney & Mbuemo are a handful, and Onyeka is pressing like mad. Direct clearances from them are great, even though we want possession. Raya has barely played a direct pass, himself.\n",

      "Everyone jumps on the bandwagon\n",
      "What has he done to create up front? Half asleep for a tap in when broja hit that ball across goal too. Go away with your criticising for the sake of it. Anyone with eyes can see he's had zero end product today again. At some point you have to produce end product you know? This guy is in his third season...\n",
      "He set up two of our most promising build ups lmao\n",
      "I think he panicked a bit and had his head down and never saw him\n",
      "you're definitely not the only one but gotta look at all the other positives there\n",
      "Always the safest pass possible. Literally doesn't try and create anything. I'm done with him, three seasons is more than enough to prove your worth.\n",

      "As long as his name isn‚Äôt Pulisic he‚Äôs fine. He will keep getting his shots\n",
      "This is really eating you up huh\n",
      "This is so true, Kai Havertz is the player that nobody knows exactly where he should play because his build, athleticism and ability together don‚Äôt put him in a concrete position. He‚Äôs built like a striker, he plays like a 10 and thinks like a winger. He makes no sense\n",
      "They get judged on 5 minutes and Kai doesn‚Äôt get judged for 85 minutes\n",
      "Being platooned into positions he doesn‚Äôt typically play or hasn‚Äôt played has really fucked with his mentality I feel like. He‚Äôs so direct and fluid for the national team.\n",

      "Looks like some kind of injury\n",
      "Hurt\n",

      "what no Silva and James does to you\n",

      "93rd*\n",
      "This ref is Australian.\n",
      "Because they didn't play Chelsea. Everyone puts on a showing against us, in part to our slow attack. We'll get up to the edge of box then pass back a bit Because we can't see or create an opportunity. Thus giving the opposition to organize defensively.\n",
      "Deluded if you think Werner would have made any difference against that Brentford back line\n",

      "Tbf to him he is playing out of position\n",

      "He saw mount. He wasn't in a position to get it across, Mee was recovering, would have cut it out\n",
      "Nah that's on Mason. Dude's head was down, keep moving for the cross across the GK. Instead he just stood there.\n",
      "They have literally nothing in common\n",

      "He is so weak but we know he has brilliance in him. But he need to be better. He can't keep losing the ball.\n",

      "Woah man this is a Christian server\n",
      "he's just so frustrating to watch these days.\n",

      "This \"shoot to solve everything\" mentality running around the sub is getting a bit out of hand.\n",

      "Exactly\n",

      "\n",

      "Agree, looking like another player we over payed for\n",
      "Dude what do you want him to do there? That was such a good touch\n",
      "Mount's been tearing it up. He was below his level today but it was stil the right call to play him. Havertz was on because Potter doesn't want to use Auba for midweek games.\n",

      "lmao you're a goblin, why did Tuchel not start him then or lampard or tuchel back in dortmund.\n",
      "As if Graham Potter gives a shit\n",
      "how is that confusing, he‚Äôs just had medical treatment\n",
      "Stinker I think RLC will be next if he‚Äôs not careful\n",
      "It‚Äôs happened to him many times this season.\n",
      "It would never happen to Rudiger.\n",

      "The champions league\n",
      "He is so weak. Can't even keep a simple ball.\n",
      "What?\n",

      "Potter may have felt we were being dominated in the middle\n",
      "We could have two goals if he had even the first touch of a Sunday league player\n",
      "I don't think it was a foul. Broja looses his footing more than was fouled. But I would have to see it again\n",
      "He gets the ball. Not even an advantage to give.\n",
      "Fr i need a replay\n",
      "Doing what?\n",
      "RLC is a fine squad player. Havertz needs to step up though\n",
      "No\n",
      "Tuchel and Potter have done him dirty. 10 minutes in the PL this entire season. You don‚Äôt do that to a player of his stature.\n",
      "They literally played 9 ATB.\n",
      ">He didn‚Äôt look spectacular \n",
      "\n",
      "Yeah, he looks awful. It‚Äôs not even like he‚Äôs average at this point he‚Äôs actively become a detriment to the attack. I‚Äôm not hating him just to hate him, I just want the best 11 on the field and he is not included in that.\n",
      "Dafuq\n",
      "Havertz won't be playing regularly for us come September of next year.\n",
      "\n",
      "Guarantee\n",
      "He‚Äôs so shit it‚Äôs getting boring now. No more excuses\n",
      "He plays with passion and never gives up, the only other player I see like him right now is Kepa\n",
      "Seems unfair, feel like he had a good involvement today\n",
      "Its easy to blame him but you think any of our attackers have flattered theirselves? Our team is still a work in progress and thats ok\n",
      "So Gallaghers natural position is #9?\n",
      "He didn‚Äôt see him, plus I don‚Äôt think he realized there would someone since how far he had to run\n",
      "We're doing pretty well in midfield imo. It's the lack of danger from width + Havertz thats hurting us\n",
      "Agreed. Havertz isn‚Äôt a winger. I don‚Äôt really like RLC in that position bc he‚Äôs better as a curator in the middle than a wing. Glad the d is staying relatively solid. I was unsure of how they‚Äôd perform. Sterling for havertz and we are up 2-0\n",
      "Brentford slapped United lol\n",
      "Neither of them should be at LWB lmao\n",
      "STOP YELLING AT ME\n",
      "I thought he‚Äôs been hit or miss. Certainly some poor games especially the first against Milan. But I thought he looked pretty nice against Villa and Wolves\n",
      "Had good stats against the worst offensive team in the league and people actually tried to say ‚Äúhe never had a bad start to begin with‚Äù. Embarrassing\n",
      "Potter wouldn‚Äôt be this ruthless\n",
      "Was wondering the same thing\n",
      "Looks that way. We were being dominated in the middle. Kova makes us tighter\n",
      "Meanwhile puligod is on the bench. The true generational player\n",
      "Dude can‚Äôt finish anyway so it doesn‚Äôt matter\n",
      "For Havertz to threaten aerially, he needs to actually get into the box once in a blue moon.\n",
      "Don‚Äôt watch then\n",
      "lmao rip\n",
      "He looked fast on the counter?\n",
      "lol\n",
      "We watching the same game?\n",
      "Yes, we‚Äôve all seen The Office.\n",
      "r/unexpectedoffice\n",
      "Yes that's his job...\n",
      "I trust RLC in that slot over Havertz.\n",
      "Havertz in midfield lol, guess we will never have the ball in the second half.\n",
      "you want Havertz to play rwb?\n",
      "Why keep havertz on at all?\n",
      "No\n",
      "not tho is it\n",
      "No one besides kova is\n",
      "In the transfer list it seems unfortunately\n",
      "It was our 10th match and we are still 4th???? Bro what????\n",
      "You are such a simpleton lol\n",
      "You are the embodiment of pestilence\n",
      "Just say you hate him because he‚Äôs American you miopic imbecile.\n",
      "Hes brilliant !\n",
      "woah it's his 4th premier game in charge relax get off tuchel nuts please , he isn't here anymore move on\n",
      "Oh fuck off\n",
      "The recycling of possession without penetration has been part of our system ever since Sarri. It will take time for Potter to fix it\n",
      "They've always been quite similar tactically.\n",
      "I was down ores for hell by saying tonepiple don't be excited by us signing him people. Look at the stats and that is it now days unfortunately\n",
      "I have been saying that too. He's average. There's a reason pep let him go and there's a reason he was not in the starting xi\n",
      "Troll\n",
      "Sterling isn‚Äôt injured though right?\n",
      "Well, when any teams lists their top players being out they are bound to play subpar. What is your point exactly? LOL\n",
      "Alonso certainly would have\n",
      "Depends on if he's healthy and in form. Kepa's making saves like Mendy now but Kepa can also pass.\n",
      "Quite the opposite, he‚Äôs very technically competent, but is just slow mentally sometimes. Takes an extra touch without realising Premier League players don‚Äôt give you that much time on the ball\n",
      "It‚Äôs more that he has a great game when he puts in effort and is crap when he‚Äôs lazy and timid. Today is the latter\n",
      "No way your talking shit about a clearance after a corner lmao\n",
      "wtf are you talking about\n",
      "He‚Äôs young. Yes he should have passed the ball but he MADE that play and got up on his feet quickly to go again\n",
      "Are you serious?\n",
      "What?????\n",
      "Must've missed his last two games where he was class.\n",
      "you‚Äôre not a blue then\n",
      "Cool?\n",
      "That's not how it works really is it...united lost 4.0 here, does that mean we are miles ahead of them?\n",
      "And if we beat United, what happens then? Arteta‚Äôs fired?\n",
      "Dude they just bounced from a 5-1 lost to Newcastle in a recent match against Brighton which they won. No way they gonna accept less than a draw at their Home.\n",
      "The reason City does it for example is that it‚Äôs hard to progress the ball in the starting position and even if the long ball doesn‚Äôt reach your player, you may have a better than usual position to win it in the press\n",
      "It‚Äôs on Amazon prime\n",
      "It‚Äôs on Amazon live\n",
      "Lol. It‚Äôs like you don‚Äôt remember our games against them last season. An utter pain in the arse.\n",
      "Yes :(\n",
      "Check new posts, Potter said they‚Äôre managing his workload (ACL injury and all)\n",
      "Took me way too long to figure out who you talking about lol\n",
      "He glanced at the match thread and died\n",
      "Injury.\n",
      "They‚Äôre not even playing as a low block\n",
      "Didn‚Äôt even look like he was injured\n",
      "Who knows. Took a ball off the leg, then went off. Didn't appear to limp off either.\n",
      "Think he wanted to but it just got stuck in his feet\n",
      "His saves were great, but his passing is excellent this game.\n",
      "Nah the key is to keep crossing it into the box with 8 Brentford players\n",
      "Broja‚Äôs movement is causing them problems, Kepa has bailed us out a few times, Kova has looked good since coming on\n",
      "Broja\n",
      "Kepa, Kova the standouts, Koulibaly, Mount and Broja all doing well too.\n",
      "\n",
      "We‚Äôre not good though\n",
      "Kepa, kova, Mount, and chalobah as well.\n",
      "Glad it wasn't only me that seen that. Even worse it looked like a red bull\n",
      "Sadly Brentford haven't gifted us goals with defensive errors\n",
      "You‚Äôd have to tell him where the net is for that even\n",

      "He played well his last time out, people just think he should get a run of games\n",
      "You‚Äôre the only one in the last 10 comments that I‚Äôve seen mention him so‚Ä¶\n",
      "Seriously???\n",
      "You need to keep in mind that we have 2 games a week until the world cup starts.\n",
      "Line up was fine. Brentford defended really well and so did we. Fair result tbh.\n",
      "Lol poor take imo. We had some solid chances. Brentford just put in a great defensive performance. Some goal saving tackles on their part. Gotta give credit where credit is due\n",
      "With Kante, Reece, and Fofana injured and a big game against United coming up we have to be smart about our starting lineup. Can't blame Potter for reserving Auba, Sterling, Silva, etc. for Saturday\n",
      "???????\n",
      "leave this sub\n",
      "It‚Äôs worth diving in the box\n",

      "Thanks man!\n",
      "The game was more painful than the end of us\n",
      "Whenever the right one comes around again\n",
      "And havertz will start again\n",
      "Lmao\n",
      "Honestly best case scenario was 2-0 win for us, Brentford looked decent\n",
      "I hate it here.  But haven't found another place to discuss Chelsea that's this active.\n",
      "Unfortunately no.  But it's been getting noticeably worse.\n",
      "if Havertz starts over him again Saturday I think he has grounds to ask out of his contract.\n",
      "Just more time WITHOUT havertz\n",
      "I'm proud of you üá±üá∑\n",
      "What you don‚Äôt understand is that Havertz is a generational talent so he needs those minutes\n",
      "But seriously, if what he's doing now is not a fluke, that he really does have all that attributes, I dare say we should've loaned him to Dortmund to give him the eyes and brains because I truly believe he will come back contesting with Haaland.\n",
      "\n",
      "Not saying he's as good as Haaland (yet), but he's gonna be a tough competitor if he can develop the smarts. That's how high I rate his raw talents in this game. It's just that Haaland is a genius because of his awareness.\n",
      "He‚Äôs actually a demon omg ü§£\n",
      "Kai is one of my favourite players but how he stays on after his performance so far is mad üòÇ\n",
      "That is absolutely not what separates them from the rest.\n",
      "Totally agree.  He seems to get in stupid little physical spats a lot.  Maybe if he reacted quicker the ball would be out of his possession and it wouldn't happen. He's in the wrong league. With space and time, he's probably fine.  But he hasn't adjusted.\n",
      "Bro you are on my ass so much bruh, fine I've said it.\n",
      "I actually think his holdup play has been quite decent\n",
      "Yeah, there must be a reason that he is being favoured by Potter and before Tuchel however when it comes to matchday he's simply not delivering. I think Pulisic has at least one goal today so far if he plays over Havertz.\n",
      "I agree and I don't rate Pulisic very highly at all lol\n",
      "Maybe you‚Äôre right, it was pretty close\n",
      "Tuchel, is that you?\n",
      "Can't take credit, a mate came out with it while we were discussing a particularly roidey ufc fighter\n",
      "Minus him üëÄüëÄ\n",
      "Sums up every Chelsea player\n",
      "(THEY‚ÄôRE DENIED)\n",
      "This is sarcasm right?\n",
      "Not happy at all, but what can you do? They defended well, and didn‚Äôt give us too many clear cut opportunities.\n",
      "We went into this knowing that we struggle with teams that A) play a low block and B) are very physical. A win would have been great, but it's been a while since we've played well against Brentford.\n",
      "Lol, he made those poor defenders look like grandpas. Crazy thing is he doesn‚Äôt even look tired when he goes rocket-mode.\n",
      "He‚Äôs only now being given a fucking chance lol. Back to bench on Saturday‚Ä¶\n",
      "I enjoy Pulisic but this is the truth. He‚Äôs certainly returning to better form now and it‚Äôs great.\n",
      "For real. Pulisic was the only one breathing life into that offense in the second half. \n",
      "\n",
      "Playmakers so far this season:\n",
      "\n",
      "1: RJ\n",
      "2: Mount\n",
      "3: Sterling\n",
      "4: Pulisic\n",
      "Lmao fuck off. He gets abused like no other from this sub and gets a third of the chances the rest of the players do. Maybe if dumbasses like you stfu and let your bias go we wouldn‚Äôt have to. Fuckin bum.\n",
      "I mean clearly is, he doesn‚Äôt lose his footing, he turns round to appeal. As clear a dive as any\n",
      "Kai is playing horrible today but he 100% is a playmaker and is best as a CAM\n",
      "Not defending him, just annoys me the amount of people who have no idea what‚Äôs going on\n",
      "I know was just venting\n",
      "First angle it didn't look like it, but second one looked like a stonewall pen. .\n",
      "I agree they were soft, but they gave ones like that in other games. so they need to be consistent.\n",
      "Cheers pal. Seems fine thru TV now but thru firecube it's naff. Weird\n",
      "Aye seems like it's a firecube problem. Weird. Cheers pal\n",
      "Wed batter Real with ease.\n",
      "Injury\n",
      "Tactical switch by the looks of it\n",
      "He was lying down\n",
      "\n",
      "I think he's fine now\n",
      "if you think that a professional football player would do that you‚Äôre nuts\n",
      "Whoops lol\n",
      "Because of your stupid ref not giving an obvious pen.\n",
      "Playing better than Havertz is not a big deal at this point.\n",
      "Out of his entire performance you point out the 1 mistake. You‚Äôre a fucking idiot\n",
      "Y‚Äôall Pulisic haters come out the woodwork the second he does anything remotely bad\n",
      "Really silly to nitpick that one moment.\n",
      "Exactly. And instead of clearing it the first time, he dribbled 10 yards deeper and lost distance on the clearance. Just empty headedness.\n",
      "Hahahaha....love that.\n",
      "\n",
      "His potential/talent keeps us both interested and frustrated\n",
      "Just a fucked up feeling I have, ok......maybe Zidane is an overstatement. Let's go with Berbatov or Bergkamp\n",
      "He wasn‚Äôt good??! Pulisic provided more goal threat to the team than anyone did before he got subbed in\n",
      "You really think he wasn‚Äôt good ? Was the only spark once he subbed in\n",
      "He created chances that would have most likely been goals if it weren't for crucial tackles on Brentfords part.\n",
      "\n",
      "But okay bro, I'm just being biased. üôÑ\n",
      "That doesn't excuse his uselessness. Everyone here criticised Pulisic for his performances even thought Tuchel played him out of position most of the time.\n",
      "Broja was the 9, Havertz was playing in his preferred number 10 role, and still fucking useless.\n",
      "He‚Äôs on high wages and he scored in the champions league final?\n",
      "Because he usually sucks asssssss\n",
      "Because he sucks\n",
      "Yeah I did Mase dirty here, the rest is awful though\n",
      "Lol, so playing a deadweight like Havertz is reasonable ? Every other options is better than using Havertz because he's shown repeatedly how useless he is for us\n",
      "Cowdude and MANY others said it repeatedly\n",
      "Who gets more chances to impress?\n",
      "we play them next my point\n",
      "First 20 minutes or so he was playing a lot deeper with Mount occupying the same position on the opposite side. I think that‚Äôs his best spot, when he‚Äôs getting plenty of the ball. He‚Äôs not a one touch poacher or dribbler so I don‚Äôt know why everyone is expecting that. His best work comes when the attack flows through him, ala Germany\n",
      "Are they bots or something at this point, there are nearly 100 every match he starts\n",
      "Guess all these coaches are dumb\n",
      "Fucking hell\n",
      "Maybe he saw how badly he was struggling and used the incident as an opportunity to bring him off, sparing them blushes.\n",
      "Manager wants to make a tactical change by subbing off a young player.\n",
      "\n",
      "To avoid the media hammering him he takes him off when he's down with a knock so it looks like it's just an injury when in fact it's tactical\n",
      "That‚Äôs not a good sign.     \n",
      "Medical room and trainers need to be assessed\n",
      "Yeah I noticed that.\n",
      "Jorginho, however Broja is at 15, he‚Äôs had a poor game no offence\n",
      "It‚Äôs a meme about Rick and Morty fans lmao\n",
      "I agree, I do. Sterling > Puli almost every day, but Havertz has been so sluggish and has had a small touch of brilliance that shouldn‚Äôt rewarded the way it is.\n",
      "He had no space at all. Worked it onto his right to get a shot away and the defender came through from behind. Everyone‚Äôs expecting this man to dribble like Messi in tight areas, he‚Äôs not that guy. He‚Äôs 6‚Äô2 ffs, he‚Äôs best when he making late runs into the box and receiving the ball in the space between the backline and mids\n",
      "Yeah I can. He got shoved in the back. I‚Äôve been there. Shits hard to keep balance if you‚Äôre starting to accelerate then shoved.\n",
      "Yes, lack of quality in key areas. No tactical approach can overcome that\n",
      "Joke mate\n",
      "Yes but only in 3 stoppages. So if we make a sub at half time we only can make one further stoppage for subs\n",
      "In only 3 Windows though. So if they make a sub or two at half they can only sub once more.\n",
      "I agree but c‚Äômon, did you see that pass he made into nowhere just now? I mean, this performance is coming very close to the worst at minimum.\n",
      "That is at least one positive attribute compared to kai\n",
      "I‚Äôm not even talking about slow internet I‚Äôm talking about the high seasüò£\n",
      "Maybe we should‚Äôve gone for someone else then? City had the right idea walking away.\n",
      "He‚Äôs been poor today. His defensive positioning is awful and he doesn‚Äôt contribute going forward.\n",
      "Sure.\n",
      "For sure. He's playing well overall but yeesh, what a chance he missed.\n",
      "Not bad just inconsistent\n",
      "I guess I don‚Äôt have eyes then! I need new glasses.\n",
      "Lol. Go rewatch 18/19. Having an extra defender helps you pass more sideways not forward‚Ä¶\n",
      "Needs more space to play with but he's never getting that in the prem\n",
      "Lol I hope you‚Äôre right\n",
      "He's very good. No flair based attacking player would thrive under Simeone\n",
      "Stating the obvious sorry if you‚Äôre so oblivious to the truth\n",
      "but even his passing has been sloppy\n",
      "Suns and dog‚Äôs arses. Most of the time he‚Äôs hitting the first man lol\n",
      "They play football.\n",
      "Bad hair\n",
      "Yea I know right. Brentford is like one of the most solid mid table team.\n",
      "Seriously, they‚Äôve been a solid team this year. Def need improvement for us but they aren‚Äôt horrible.\n",
      "We've played like ass when in possession, and potter started the game in this toothless 343 formation. We have to look at our mistakes first before praising Brentford\n",
      "Mate, a top flight side should be beating Brentford 2 0\n",
      "Yeah I mean he‚Äôs had a rough season but this start is one of his more positive than I‚Äôve seen in his last 6+ apps\n",
      "Has he? What game am i watching then lol\n",
      "What has Kai done to deserve playing time this year? Dude is a trash can to be honest.\n",
      "I really would like to know after seeing Pulis sub appearance today how you could possibly think Kai deserves playing time over Puli. He did more in 10 minutes than Kai did in 80.\n",
      "Nothing but this subs need to constantly find a player to pick on and bash is infuriating. As soon as one gets back in form everyone scurries to find the next.\n",
      "Why? Because he fell after Mee stepped on his ankle?\n",
      "Absolutely unnecessary singing considering we have Maatsen who is very similar in strengths and weaknesses. And overpaid for it.\n",
      "Taken it first time\n",
      "Shoot first time instead of taking a touch in their box?\n",
      "You can't just run him into the ground. Guy deserves a breather\n",
      "Both Frank and TT started him quite frequently actually. More than Potter has so far at least.\n",
      "I zoned out to be fair but I didn‚Äôt see what got him injured so I was just really surprised\n",
      "Wasting time to get a sub ready\n",
      "üòÇüòÇüòÇ\n",
      "Mate i want him to do well. We are so used to such mediocrity up front that we accept someone who doesnt contribute to the team but might nick a goal every 4 games.\n",
      "Living off that goal. Done nothing since.\n",
      "wake me up when kai performance has ever been as good as puli against porto or real madrid.\n",
      "Newcastle 5. Arsenal 3.\n",
      "Newcastle 5. Arsenal 3.\n",
      "Thank you for this.  Some are just absolutely clueless\n",
      "It sure didn‚Äôt look like he got the ball‚Ä¶\n",
      "Working.\n",
      "Fair point. Havertz is terrible\n",
      "Need to hate on though? Why not hate on Potter for picking him then?\n",
      "\n",
      "Havertz is subpar recently but at the same time our front 3 link up is shite/work in progress.\n",
      "\n",
      "It's still our player, constructive criticism is absolutely correct. Pure hate comments are low.\n",
      "I just don‚Äôt see him scoring any goals for all the hype and passion. Auba should have started and may be given Broja his 10 mins after we had a goal or two, shouldn‚Äôt have started Kai as well.\n",
      "Missed opportunities is what I could see to be fair.\n",
      "Havertz's performance in his 3rd year after an 80m transfer is absolutely not ok\n",
      "An astute observer may notice Broja is playing #9. Not you though.\n",
      "I agree, been much better since kova has come on, just missing a bit of luck in the attack\n",
      "Auba lappd him with the ball\n",
      "Maybe not a statue but his movement or maybe awareness is lacking today. I dunno, maybe I‚Äôm wrong!\n",
      "Oh they teach it like that in real CPR classes, not just the show\n",
      "Parks and rec>>>>>\n",
      "Well I don‚Äôt like it.  Keep pushing\n",
      "No I want 4 in the back\n",
      "Anthony Taylor would‚Äôve given it and VAR wouldn‚Äôt have overturned it\n",
      "It's best for him to leave in January also Ziyech.\n",
      "I think he/she is.\n",
      "His post history shows the only action he gets is touching himself while posting on Reddit about how bad he things Pulisic is\n",
      "Broja should‚Äôve passed sooner, but Mason gave up on it too early.\n",
      "So we're better than Man Utd and worse than Arsenal.\n",
      "We haven't beaten them in 5 years in the league so we probably won't beat them tbh.\n",
      "Thanks for the explanation u/PuppyPenetrator\n",
      "Can't find it :(\n",
      "I'm getting a feeling it isn't in Germany, at least I can't figure out how to navigate to it\n",
      "Remember both games, that‚Äôs why I want us to overcome this\n",
      "Cheers mate. I missed that\n",
      "‚ÄúKepa has bailed us out a few times‚Äù\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Imagine saying this over a year ago‚Ä¶\n",
      "Forgot Chalobah\n",
      "Yeah happy that Kepa got his confidence back\n",
      "Won't be surprised if he is lol, i blame potter for this performance\n",
      "It hit his thigh\n",
      "[deleted]\n",
      "We have enough players to play a 433 with rotation and stop using this toothless 343 that doesn't suit most of our squad, we've seen 343 many times failing against compact PL sides, don't know why that's not clear\n",
      "Well we've rested players now but dropped points so mission failed, let's hope we win saturday\n",
      "Oh wow imagine my surprise I get downvoted a ton. And I didn't even say anything that controversial ffs, he's not strong at all. It's a fact. And I praised him for trying to take on his man, but yes the logic of this sub to jump on anyone that even dream of criticism on him lol\n",
      "Low bar\n",
      "That's a tap in he missed.\n",
      "Who put 50p in you?\n",
      "Villa destroyed us, Brentford too. We have no plan going forward, Kepa has been keeping us alive for the last 180 minutes of football. Mount and Broja have been two of our best players and he is taking them off. And what's the point of Cucurella? Can't cross, can't defend. Knows how to pass sideways and that's about it.\n",
      "It's really just a low IQ take to be fair\n",
      "Alright mate hold these stats for me. Most possession lost out the whole team, no shots on target, currently a 6.2 rating on SS. 1 dribble completed. Just shhhhh you melt ü•±ü§´ü§´\n",
      "I agree, just not as an 8\n",
      "Really?  This entire thread is ‚Äúshit on (insert player name)‚Äù. ‚ÄúSell (player name). It‚Äôs a cesspool of shit fans.\n",
      "definitely. can‚Äôt take that away from Brentford. they were solid but just seems that Broja has a Giroud like play style with a bit more of physique and pressing and so Auba and him upfront could‚Äôve caused issues\n",
      "If you find a place, let me know. I used to frequent WAGNH but haven't been there in years\n",
      "Every time I step into one I ask myself why I keep subjecting myself to it.  But I'm watching at work so it helps for some background on what's going on if I miss a play or an injury or whatever.\n",
      "What does then? Ability only takes you so far. And we know Kai has the ability. We‚Äôve seen it.\n",
      "It started with me being annoyed by you, but I've grown to care about you.\n",
      "Really? He hasn't had any layoffs or combinations, I think he's lost 4/5 duels\n",
      "True dat, Jorgh was horrendous the first few games of the season\n",
      "How is it sarcasm, they destroyed us last season and they just got back to back wins. Always going to be a physical and a deep block match. Home advantage‚Ä¶\n",
      "Brentford away is a difficult and uncomfortable game for all the teams in the league especially in those cold nights they always turn up with good atmosphere and defence\n",
      "I felt we took it a bit easy with a second tier starting line up.\n",
      "This. His past showings has been great. He was phenomenal a couple of seasons ago and if he returns to that form... That would be great.\n",
      "I have no bias. Why would I have bias? Like I hate Americans or something? He's just not that good in most of our estimations and has never managed double figures goals in a league season. Between him and Sterling it's an easy choice.\n",
      "What are you smoking\n",
      "No he isn‚Äôt, check his underlying stats and his assist numbers. There is no debate even‚Ä¶\n",
      "I mean its the third pen that wasnt given so it was obvious it wouldnt be given either way, horrific refereeing\n",
      "What does y‚Äôall mean\n",
      "Yup, something must have knocked his confidence a bit. You could almost see the cogs turning in his head when he had that opportunity to shoot.\n",
      "[deleted]\n",
      "Contradicting statements but okay\n",
      "That is literally not relevant to me they are both not good enough or consistent enough to be a starter for us I‚Äôd get rid of both of them in a heartbeat.\n",
      "It was a genuine question. I‚Äôd love an actual answer\n",
      "Terrible terrible managers. Don‚Äôt have a clue\n",
      "This is the knowledge I crave\n",
      "I know that meme which is about 4 years old, but just saying it doesn't really apply here or make any sense\n",
      "Oh I know. He is dead wood, he hasn't been a good player for years, we has a streak of magic twice a season, that isn't good enough for constantly playing like a EFL player.\n",

      "Good point, forgot about that\n",

      "Exactly. He just hasn‚Äôt adapted, although he also hasn‚Äôt had managerial consistency.\n",
      "And what flair based attacking player has thrived at Chelsea besides Hazard?\n",
      "so what happened last season since u like to speak the truth..truth teller\n",
      "Haha universe never wants me to be right either\n",
      "One of them does\n",
      "Lots of nuance in that take. If only it were that simple. There‚Äôs no team in the league that consistently beats teams they ‚Äúshould‚Äù beat. Man City should have beat Aston Villa, just because they didn‚Äôt doesn‚Äôt mean alarm bells start ringing. The game is played on the day, what ‚Äúshould‚Äù happen is never a guarantee\n",
      "Yeah and some people would rather talk about two soft fouls\n",
      "Idk, try to look harder. He's no. 29 btw\n",
      "As bad as that is its sports, always someone to blame unless we're dominant\n",
      "Agreed\n",
      "So it's completely wasted because he didn't strike a volley with his weak foot. You're being insanely harsh\n",
      "fair\n",

Inconsistent players are the most frustrating players. Pulisic and Havertz are the best examples of it. We know they can be good but the problem is they don‚Äôt show it often enough. Timo is the example of a player that just isn‚Äôt good enough.\n",

      "If you have any experience playing or coaching football on any level, the failings of today are glaring. For a start we spent 20 mins passing it around the most flooded area in the middle of the pitch and not using the 900 acres of space on the wings, no players ere attempting to make any kind of run, passed it around for 5 minutes then had a long range pot shot, rinse and repeat 10 times. That isn't how a title challenger plays football.\n",

      "That‚Äôs essentially exactly how City played against a Villa team that is much worse than this Brentford. We definitely had several clear chances and were one pass away from an open goal several times as well. You‚Äôre making this out to be some atrocious, dismal outing, when it was just a game against a low block, while rotating players, and several injuries. Potter changed the tactics and made positive subs, my only issue was Havertz looked lost. There were plenty of runs, attempts to pick out said runs, plenty of wing play. They were quick to be out wide and had a great press system. Just typical doomsday speak while we‚Äôre on a 7 game unbeaten streak with 5 of those being consecutive victories. Just delusional pessimism, get a grip. A million times more potent this game than whatever the fuck Tuchel was trying towards the end of his tenure, the way you word your statements there‚Äôs a clear unwarranted bitterness towards Potter. Assess your own life and improve.\n",

      "I don‚Äôt want to blame Potter, per se, but I too am left questioning personnel decisions every now and then. He‚Äôs completely turned us around so I trust him, but I would love to hear his reasoning why Pulisic isn‚Äôt playing more\n",

      "oops...my bad\n",

You know you can critique someone without being on the other side of the political war? For example you can criticise pulisic without thinking mount is the best thing since sliced bread?\n",
      "\n",
      "It isnt doomsday speak at all, we categorically did not play well the other night. Granted, Brentford are a great team and doing very well, but we did not play at our best the other night. Yes we have some players injured and a tight schedule, but resting our most affective players and tinkering is not the right thing to do against Brentford.\n",
      "puli performance today is better than what havertz ever shown in a chelsea shirt.\n",
      "Questioning is absolutely fine in my book. I just can't stand the hate; people seem to pick on one player and just pile up. It was Jorgi last season, now it's Kai, it'll be someone else later. I just don't get the hate.\n",

      "So we‚Äôve literally had no player thrive in our attack since Hazard because of his pure class, yet you randomly expect Felix to do well. And you‚Äôd like to trade Havertz and a chuck in a load more money for him. He hasn‚Äôt even been brilliant at Atletico, wasn‚Äôt worth his price tag. We haven‚Äôt had a big money attacker do well. Yet calling me stupid‚Ä¶ What actual reasons can you provide to say he‚Äôll thrive at Chelsea. \n",
      "\n",
      "Also‚Ä¶ Ramires as a flair based attacking player‚Ä¶ what Ramires are you talking about because the only Ramires who played for us was a more defensive minded midfield engine, who occasionally was utilised as a box to box player.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "I don't randomly expect him to do well, I think he's very talented and Havertz clearly hasn't worked out and we could do with a change.\n",

      "> he hasn't even been brilliant at Atletico\n",
      "\n",
      "I've already addressed this. Their system isn't conducive to any attacking player shining.\n",
      "\n",
      "I was out of line calling Ramires an attacking player, but he did have buckets of flair. All I meant to say is being a flair player shouldn't be a disqualifier.\n",
      "I just don‚Äôt understand the logic of:\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "But also again, for what reason do you think Felix will do well is our system, or well for us in general\n",
      "I didn't say loads of money, but it's unlikely it'd be a direct swap. As for our system, I feel Graham has already been trying different systems with different personnel, and it is a matter of Havertz being not very good at the basics like receiving and feeding other players, and that's something Felix might be better at. Not evidenced by recent forms, agreed. But I feel he's capable of it and has shown it before and soon after moving to Atletico.\n"

Our ball movement is slow. From most first touches being backwards to too many touches on the ball to lack of movement off-ball so less options... Kovacic has helped immensely since coming on.\\n3. This surely was the game to play Auba and Broja together, right? Speed in central defense and tracking runners are Brentford's 2 main weakness at the back. Broja is showing his physicality and aggression with his press and playing direct, but Havertz looks lost out there. The pair are really out of sync with their positioning and movements in the box.\\n4. Chalobah and Kepa have looked very composed, which is great to see. Toney & Mbuemo are a handful, and Onyeka is pressing like mad. Direct clearances from them are great, even though we want possession. Raya has barely played a direct pass, himself.\\n5. Our service into the box has been poor. Some hesitation on our crosses allowed opposition to reset, also poor balls in without a target.\\n\\nWe're looking the better team, but only just.

       "3029  \"Asses your own life and improve.\"\\n\\nWow, really classy. I have no bitterness towards Potter at all, I think he is miles better than tuchel for a lot of reasons. You know you can critique someone without being on the other side of the political war? For example you can criticise pulisic without thinking mount is the best thing since sliced bread?\\n\\nIt isnt doomsday speak at all, we categorically did not play well the other night. Granted, Brentford are a great team and doing very well, but we did not play at our best the other night. Yes we have some players injured and a tight schedule, but resting our most affective players and tinkering is not the right thing to do against Brentford.   \n",

       "3029  \"Asses your own life and improve.\"  Wow, really classy. I have no bitterness towards Potter at all, I think he is miles better than tuchel for a lot of reasons. You know you can critique someone without being on the other side of the political war? For example you can criticise pulisic without thinking mount is the best thing since sliced bread?  It isnt doomsday speak at all, we categorically did not play well the other night. Granted, Brentford are a great team and doing very well, but we did not play at our best the other night. Yes we have some players injured and a tight schedule, but resting our most affective players and tinkering is not the right thing to do against Brentford.  \n",

       "3029  \"Asses your own life and improve.\"\\n\\nWow, really classy. I have no bitterness towards Potter at all, I think he is miles better than tuchel for a lot of reasons. You know you can critique someone without being on the other side of the political war? For example you can criticise pulisic without thinking mount is the best thing since sliced bread?\\n\\nIt isnt doomsday speak at all, we categorically did not play well the other night. Granted, Brentford are a great team and doing very well, but we did not play at our best the other night. Yes we have some players injured and a tight schedule, but resting our most affective players and tinkering is not the right thing to do against Brentford.   \n",

       "3029  \"Asses your own life and improve.\"  Wow, really classy. I have no bitterness towards Potter at all, I think he is miles better than tuchel for a lot of reasons. You know you can critique someone without being on the other side of the political war? For example you can criticise pulisic without thinking mount is the best thing since sliced bread?  It isnt doomsday speak at all, we categorically did not play well the other night. Granted, Brentford are a great team and doing very well, but we did not play at our best the other night. Yes we have some players injured and a tight schedule, but resting our most affective players and tinkering is not the right thing to do against Brentford.   \n",
